## Attack scenario

The PS/2 signal represents an appealing and relatively favourable target for
eavesdropping. The main advantage is its serial nature as data is transmitted
one bit at a time. Also, PS/" is use is idely spread across IoT solutions, such as [ATMs](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Vandalproof-16-Keys-Stainless-Steel-Keyboard_60817438401.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.normalList.23.47c676f0u6gqsh) or Access Control Systems.

As the wires are very close and not shielded against each other it is theorized
that a fortuitous leakage of information goes from the data wire to the ground
wire and/or cable shielding due to electromagnetic coupling.

The ground wire as well as the cable shielding are routed to the main power
adapter/cable ground which is then connected to the power socket and finally
the electric grid.

This eventually leads to keystrokes leakage to the electric grid which can then
be detected on the power outlet itself, including nearby ones sharing the same
electric line.

The clock frequency of the PS/2 signal is lower than any other component or
signal emanated from the PC (everything else is typically above the MHz), this
allows noise filtering and keystrokes signal extraction.

In order to implement the attack the ground from a nearby power socket is
routed to the ADC using a modified power cable (remember the disclaimer) which
separates the ground wire for probing and includes a resistor between the two
probe hooks. The current dispersed on the ground is measured using the voltage
potential difference between the two ends of the resistor.

With "nearby" power socket we identify anything connected to the same electric
system within a reasonable range, distances are discussed in the results
paragraph.

In order to accomplish the measurement a "reference" ground is needed, as any
ADC would need a proper ground for its own operation but at the same time the
electrical grid ground is the target of our measurements. Because of this the
main ground cannot be used as the equipment ground, as that would lead to null
potential difference at the two ends of the probe.

A "reference" ground is any piece of metal with a direct physical connection to
the Earth, a sink or toilet pipe is perfect for this purpose (while albeit not
very classy) and easily reachable (especially if you are performing the attack
from an hotel room).

Andrea "lcars" Barisani and Daniele Bianco's research shows there is no significant degradation of signal quality between 1 and 15 meter tests, suggesting that attenuation is not a concern at this range.

*It should be noted that attenuation coefficients for wire copper are often
estimated for much higher frequencies (>1Mhz) than the PS/2 signal, considering
a typical copper cable with a coefficient of 0.1 dB after 60m theoretically
(strong emphasis here) 50% of the signal survives. For reference a typical
leakage emission has an output power of ~1 nW (10^-9 Watt).*

In conclusion the results clearly show that information about the keyboard
keystrokes indeed leaks on the power grid and can be remotely detected.
