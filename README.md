# deside COMING-SOON
A tool for side chanel data leakage attacks. Pre-alpha.


## Prerequisites

See requirements.txt


### Early tests.
For a brief overlook at some of the program's key features, run it like so. Note that the program is on a very early development stage.

```
python3.6 main.py
```

## Program features and flow.

* Data source parsing
* Asynchronous source correction.
* Discrete time iFFT/notch based 50-60 Hertz power grid noise reduction. 
* Discrete time FIR based band pass filter to isolate target frequency.
* Signal smoothing. See [FILTERS](.#Filters)
* Digital conversion with hystheresis.
* Packet decoding, checksum.
* Statistical collision attack on ps2 packets.
* Statistcal frequency analysis on decoded text messages.


## Attack scenario.

*Coming soon.
